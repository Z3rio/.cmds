# .cmds

This is a list of bat scripts to help your Windows terminal experience a bit better

I primarily use this since I'm used to Linux commands such as `cat`, `rm`, etc.

Using this, I can use those commands in the comfort of a normal Windows terminal.

## Credits

A lot of this code is based on different sources from Github, StackOverflow, etc.

## Backstory/Usage

My personal reasoning behind using/wanting this is that I often run nvim on my local Windows dev environment.

This means that it uses normal Windows terminals for Neovim terminals, instead of WSL, which is what I normally use.

So I created this primarily to be able to use those old Linux commands in Neovim ;)

## Installation

You would for obvious reasons want the batch files to be automatically executed on startup.

You can do this by following these steps:

- Create a shortcut of the scripts you want
- Press win + r
- Input `shell:startup` and press enter
- Drag the shortcuts into there
