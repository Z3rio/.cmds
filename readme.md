# .cmds

This is a list of bat scripts to help your windows terminal experience a bit better

I primarily use this since I'm used to linux commands such as `cat`, `rm`, etc.

Using this, I can use those commands in the comfort of a normal windows terminal.

## Credits

A lot of this code is based off of different sources from github, stackoverflow, etc.

## Installation

You would for obvious reasons want this the batch files to be automatically executed on startup.

Which you can do by following these steps:

- Create a shortcuts of the scripts you want
- Press win + r
- Input `shell:startup` and press enter
- Drag the shortcuts into there
